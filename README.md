# Healthcare Market Expansion Strategy – Finland

## Project overview
This project simulates an analytics consulting assignment for an (imaginary) private healthcare company exploring opportunities to invest their business in smaller Finnish counties. The objective was to identify counties with **high potential demand** and **low competitive intensity** to support data-driven investment decisions.

## 🎯 Business objectives
- Assess regional healthcare demand accross Finnish counties
- Evaluate counties on their current and future potential for succesful investment
- Identify clear counties to invest in
- Provide a PowerBI dashboard solution from the analysis

## 🏥 Market context
Smaller counties in Finland can present untapped opportunities for private healthcare providers due to:
- Ageing population
- Limited access to public healthcare due to increasing demand

Private healthcare providers:
- Big part of revenue comes from occupational health services
- Clientele is usually middle aged and employed people

Competition:
- Finland has many private healthcare companies so the competition is high

## 📊 Tools and Technologies
- Power BI (Dashboards, data model, deeper analysis)
- Excel (Data preprocessing)

## Data 
- Open demographical data on counties from Finland 2021-2023:https://pxdata.stat.fi/PxWeb/pxweb/fi/Postinumeroalueittainen_avoin_tieto/Postinumeroalueittainen_avoin_tieto__uusin/paavo_pxt_12f8.px/
- Open prediction of changes in demographical data on counties from Finland 2035: https://pxdata.stat.fi/PxWeb/pxweb/fi/StatFin/StatFin__vaenn/statfin_vaenn_pxt_14wx.px/

## Workflow of the project 
1. Understand the information needs and business environment of the customer
2. Extract data for our analysis
3. Clean and prepare data for PowerBI
4. Analyze the data based on identified business objectives and information needs
5. Build and provide PowerBI dashboard solution to support the customer in strategic decision making

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Counties with high median income and large population are centered around urban areas where the competition is heavy
- Most smaller counties have population loss on long term according to demographic prediction
- Our data doesn't give a good picture of the whole business environment (Further analysis needed)
- Few counties stood out from our analysis on relevant metrics

## 💡 Recommendations
- 2 potential investment opportunities: Naantali and Riihimäki concentration
- Make full market analysis on these locations: Competitors, potential business partners, short term forecasting
